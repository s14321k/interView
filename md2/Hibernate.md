# Hibernate Concepts Explained

<details open>
<summary><strong>1. Eager vs Lazy Loading</strong></summary>

### What is it?

* **Lazy Loading:** Delay fetching related entities until they are actually accessed.
* **Eager Loading:** Fetch related entities immediately with the parent entity.

### Why use?

* Lazy loading improves performance when related data is not always needed.
* Eager loading is useful when you always need related entities.

---

| Feature           | Lazy Loading                                  | Eager Loading                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| When data loads   | On first access to related entity             | Immediately with parent entity               |
| Default usage     | `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany` (lazy by default) | `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne` (eager by default) |
| Annotation syntax | `fetch = FetchType.LAZY`                      | `fetch = FetchType.EAGER`                    |
| Performance       | Faster initial load, but possible N+1 queries | Slower initial load, fewer queries           |
| Use case          | Large collections, optional relations         | Small relations always required              |

---

### Example:

```java
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private Set<Order> orders;
```

<summary><strong>2. SessionFactory</strong></summary>

* Responsible for creating Hibernate `Session` objects.
* Thread-safe and heavy-weight, usually one per application/database.
* Holds metadata and configuration of ORM mapping.
* Use at app startup, keep for the app lifecycle.
* Sessions created by SessionFactory are used to perform DB operations (`save`, `update`, `delete`).

---

```java
SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
```

</details>

<summary><strong>3. Data Connection Setup and Configuration</strong></summary>

* Configure `hibernate.cfg.xml` or `application.properties` with DB URL, username, password, dialect.
* Example properties for Spring Boot:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=pass
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
```

* Hibernate uses these configs to establish DB connection and manage sessions.

<summary><strong>4. Stored Procedures vs Prepared Statements</strong></summary>

| Feature     | PreparedStatement                          | Stored Procedure                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Definition  | Precompiled parameterized SQL query        | Precompiled SQL logic stored in DB         |
| Use case    | Dynamic queries with parameters            | Complex operations, multiple queries       |
| Security    | Prevents SQL injection by parameterization | Can enhance security via controlled access |
| Performance | Good for repeated queries                  | Optimized execution in DB engine           |
| Portability | Portable across DBs                        | Often DB-specific syntax                   |
| Java usage  | `Connection.prepareStatement(sql)`         | `Connection.prepareCall("{CALL proc(?)}")` |

---

### Example PreparedStatement:

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
ps.setInt(1, 100);
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
```

### Example Stored Procedure call:

```java
CallableStatement cs = connection.prepareCall("{CALL GetUser(?)}");
cs.setInt(1, 100);
ResultSet rs = cs.executeQuery();
```

<summary><strong>5. Cascading in Hibernate</strong></summary>

* Cascading controls how operations on a parent entity propagate to its related child entities.
* Useful to keep DB consistent without manual handling of each related entity.

---

| Cascade Type  | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALL`         | All operations (`persist`, `merge`, `remove`, etc.) cascade to children |
| `PERSIST`     | Persist operation cascades                                              |
| `MERGE`       | Merge operation cascades                                                |
| `REMOVE`      | Remove (delete) operation cascades                                      |
| `DETACH`      | Detach operation cascades                                               |
| `REPLICATE`   | Replicate operation cascades                                            |
| `SAVE_UPDATE` | Save or update cascades                                                 |

---

### Example:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy="customer", cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
private Set<Order> orders;
```

---

Use cascade carefully—deleting a parent can delete all children!

<summary><strong>6. Hibernate get() vs load()</strong></summary>

| Feature     | `get()`                                                       | `load()`                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Behavior    | Immediately hits DB, returns entity or `null` if not found    | Returns proxy, hits DB only on property access      |
| When to use | When you want to fetch immediately and check if entity exists | When you expect entity exists and want lazy loading |
| Exception   | Returns `null` if not found                                   | Throws `ObjectNotFoundException` if entity missing  |

---

### Example `get()`:

```java
MyEntity e = session.get(MyEntity.class, id);
if (e == null) { /* not found */ }
```

### Example `load()`:

```java
MyEntity e = session.load(MyEntity.class, id);
// DB query only happens when e.getName() is called
```

<summary><strong>7. Hibernate vs JPA</strong></summary>

| Criteria       | Hibernate                                  | JPA                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Nature         | Full-featured ORM framework                | Java specification (standard API)            |
| Features       | Advanced features (multi-tenancy, caching) | Basic ORM features                           |
| Portability    | Less portable due to proprietary features  | Portable across JPA providers                |
| Ecosystem      | Mature, large community                    | Part of Java EE ecosystem                    |
| Implementation | Can be used standalone or as JPA provider  | Needs a provider like Hibernate, EclipseLink |

---

### Choose Hibernate if:

* You want advanced ORM features
* Working with legacy Hibernate projects
* Need vendor-specific extensions

### Choose JPA if:

* You want standardization and portability
* Building Java EE / Jakarta EE apps
* Prefer simpler API

---

<details open>
<summary>Use Hibernate as JPA provider for best of both worlds.</summary>

```java
// Use Hibernate's EntityManager implementation
javax.persistence.EntityManager em = ...
```

<summary><strong>8. Connection Pooling in Java</strong></summary>

* Manages a pool of database connections for reuse.
* Improves app response time by avoiding connection creation overhead.
* Crucial for high traffic web apps to reduce DB load.

---

### Benefits:

* Faster connection retrieval
* Limits max DB connections to avoid overload
* Reuses idle connections

---

### Popular pools:

* HikariCP (default in Spring Boot)
* Apache DBCP
* C3P0

---

### Example Spring Boot config:

```properties
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
```

---

Use connection pooling to drastically improve scalability and performance.
