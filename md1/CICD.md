# 🚀 Production-Grade DevOps CI/CD Architecture

This document describes a **real-world, production-ready DevOps CI/CD architecture** that is **simple, automated, reliable, and scalable**.

---

## 🧩 High-Level Overview

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand summary</strong></summary>

A developer pushes code to **GitHub/GitLab**, which automatically triggers **Jenkins**.  
Jenkins builds, tests, containerizes, and deploys the application to **Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)**.  
All infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform (IaC)**.  
The application is exposed securely via **ALB Ingress**, monitored using **Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch**, and alerts are delivered through **SNS**.

This setup ensures:
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automated infrastructure
- Observability and reliability
- Fast feedback loops

</details>

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Workflow (Jenkins)

<details>
<summary><strong>CI/CD Flow Details</strong></summary>

1. Developer pushes code to **GitHub / GitLab**
2. Webhook triggers **Jenkins pipeline**
3. Jenkins performs:
  - Source code checkout
  - Build and unit tests
  - Docker image build
  - Push image to AWS container registry (ECR)
  - Deploy application to Kubernetes (EKS)

Jenkins acts as the **central CI/CD engine**, enforcing consistency and automation across environments.

</details>

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

<details>
<summary><strong>Infrastructure Provisioning</strong></summary>

All infrastructure is provisioned automatically using **Terraform**, ensuring repeatability and version control.

Terraform provisions:

# 🔄 Rollback Strategy in DevOps

<details open>
<summary><strong>🔄 Rollback Strategy in DevOps</strong></summary>

In DevOps, ensuring a **rollback strategy** is critical for maintaining application stability during failed deployments.
A solid rollback plan reduces downtime and prevents broken code from affecting users.

---

<details open>
<summary>1️⃣ ✅ Version Control</summary>

* Every deployment is **versioned** using Git tags or commit hashes.
* This allows quick reversion to a previously stable version.

**Example:**

```bash
# Deploying with a specific Git tag
git checkout v1.2.3
git push origin main
```

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>2️⃣ 🧪 Canary & Blue-Green Deployments</summary>

* **Canary Deployment:** Roll out changes to a small portion of users first.
* **Blue-Green Deployment:** Run two environments (Blue = stable, Green = new). If failure occurs, route traffic back to Blue.

**Example (Kubernetes Canary):**

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: canary
```

This lets only part of the traffic hit the new version.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>3️⃣ 🧰 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</summary>

* Using tools like **Terraform**, infra changes are tracked in code.
* Rollback = simply reapply the last known good config.

**Example (Terraform):**

```bash
# Roll back to previous infra state
terraform apply "previous_plan.tfplan"
```

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>4️⃣ 📦 Immutable Deployments</summary>

* Containers/images are **immutable** → no in-place edits.
* To rollback, redeploy the last **working image** by version tag.

**Example (Docker):**

```bash
# Rollback to last stable version
docker run myapp:v1.2.3
```

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>5️⃣ 📜 Rollback Scripts & CI/CD Logic</summary>

* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) monitor deployment health.
* If failure detected → pipeline **auto-triggers rollback**.

**Example (GitHub Actions):**

```yaml
- name: Deploy New Version
  run: docker run myapp:latest

- name: Health Check
  run: curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

- name: Rollback on Failure
  if: failure()
  run: docker run myapp:v1.2.3
```

</details>

---

## ✅ Real-World Example

🚀 A **Node.js app** was deployed using GitHub Actions + Docker.
🔍 During the **health check stage**, a `500` error was detected.
💡 GitHub Actions **immediately executed rollback** to the previous Docker image.

```yaml
- name: Rollback to Previous Image
  run: docker run myapp:v1.2.3
```

💥 Result: **Downtime avoided**, users never saw disruption.

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

A strong rollback strategy = 🔐 **safer deployments** + 😌 **peace of mind**.
👉 Always **test rollback paths** before you need them.

```test
  🚀 Start Deployment
          |
          v
📦 Deploy New Version
          |
          v
🔍 Run Health Checks
     /           \
 Pass            Fail
  |                |
  v                v
✅ Keep New      ❌ Trigger Rollback
   Version         |
    \              v
     \          ↩️ Rollback to
      \------>  Last Stable Version
                    |
                    v
             ✅ Service Stable
```

# 📚 Loading a Shared Library in a Jenkinsfile

<details open>
<summary><strong> Loading a Shared Library in a Jenkinsfile</strong></summary>

A **Jenkins Shared Library** is stored in a Git repository and allows you to reuse pipeline functions and classes across multiple Jenkins pipelines.
You load it in your **Jenkinsfile** using the `@Library` annotation (or the `library` step).

---

<details open>
<summary>1️⃣ Preconfigured Global Library</summary>

👉 If your Jenkins admin has already set up the shared library in
**Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Global Pipeline Libraries**,
you can load it by its name only.

**Example:**

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-lib') _   // 📦 load the shared library

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Call Library Function') {
            steps {
                // 📞 call function defined in vars/hello.groovy
                helloWorld()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

💡 `helloWorld()` comes from `vars/hello.groovy` inside the shared library.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>2️⃣ Load Dynamically from GitHub</summary>

👉 If not preconfigured globally, you can load the library directly from Git.

**Example:**

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-lib@main') _   // 🔖 load library from branch "main"

library identifier: 'my-shared-lib@main', retriever: modernSCM([
  $class: 'GitSCMSource',
  remote: 'https://github.com/org/shared-library.git' // 🌐 GitHub repo
])

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Use Library Function') {
            steps {
                // 🛠 use shared library function
                deployApp("staging")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

💡 `deployApp()` comes from `vars/deployApp.groovy` in the shared lib.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>3️⃣ Version-Specific Library</summary>

👉 To ensure **stability across teams**, load a specific version or tag.

**Example:**

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-lib@v1.2.0') _   // 🏷 load library version v1.2.0
```

This way, pipelines won’t break when newer versions of the library are updated.

</details>

---

✅ **Summary:**

* `@Library('<name>@<version>')` → loads the library.
* Global libraries need only the name.
* Dynamic libraries require `library` + Git repo config.
* Always prefer **tagged versions** for production stability.

# 🌟 How IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) Handles Versioning

<details open>
<summary><strong>How IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) Handles Versioning</strong></summary>

✅ In IBM **UrbanCode Deploy (UCD)**, versioning is a **core feature** that ensures deployments are:

* **Repeatable** 🌀
* **Traceable** 📝
* **Rollback-safe** 🔄

---

<details open>
<summary>1️⃣ 📦 Component Versions</summary>

* Every build artifact (**JAR, WAR, config files, Docker image**) is stored as a **version** in UCD.
* Versions are immutable → you can always redeploy the same artifact exactly.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>2️⃣ 🗄️ CodeStation Repository</summary>

* UCD’s **internal artifact repo** = CodeStation.
* Stores all component versions **securely and immutably**.
* Guarantees you always deploy the artifact as it was built.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>3️⃣ 🔄 Rollbacks</summary>

* Since all past versions are retained, UCD enables **rollback to any previous version** with just a few clicks.
* Rollback uses the same deployment process as forward deployments → **safe & consistent**.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>4️⃣ 🌐 Deployment Mapping</summary>

* Each environment (Dev, QA, Prod) can be mapped to **different versions** of the same component.
* UCD shows a clear **audit trail**:

  * QA → `v1.2.5`
  * Prod → `v1.2.3`

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>5️⃣ ⚙️ Automation</summary>

* Deployment processes can:

  * Auto-pick the latest version 🚀
  * Or prompt the user to select a version before deploying 🎛️
* Ensures flexibility across different environments.

</details>

---

## 🔎 Real-World Example

* A **build job** creates artifact → `v1.2.5`.
* Uploaded to UCD as a **component version**.
* QA deploys `v1.2.5`.
* Prod still runs `v1.2.3`.
* If Prod deployment of `v1.2.5` fails → **rollback to `v1.2.3` instantly**.

---

## 📊 Visual Flow (ASCII)

```text
🏗️ Build Artifact (v1.2.5)
        |
        v

Perfect 🙌 Let’s structure this in the same **parent-child collapsible style** as before.
Here, the **parent** is the main question (`How do you deploy Docker images using GitLab?`) and each **child** section contains the detailed steps.

---

<details open>
<summary>🐳 How do you deploy Docker images using GitLab?</summary>

👉 In GitLab CI/CD, deploying Docker images usually involves **3 main steps**:
1️⃣ Build the Docker image.
2️⃣ Push the image to a registry (GitLab Container Registry, DockerHub, ECR, ACR).
3️⃣ Deploy the image to your environment (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or VM).

---

<details open>
<summary>1️⃣ Configure GitLab CI/CD</summary>

* Add a **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** file in your repo.
* Use **GitLab Runners** with Docker installed.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>2️⃣ Authenticate with Registry 🔑</summary>

* Store your registry credentials as **CI/CD variables**:

  * `DOCKER_USER`
  * `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

* These are **masked & secure 🔒** in GitLab.

</details>

---

<details open>
<summary>3️⃣ Build & Push the Image 🏗️➡️</summary>

**`.gitlab-ci.yml` snippet:**
